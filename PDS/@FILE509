//*           The Unix guys have such cool stuff(!) to display      *   FILE 509
//*           their little machines on the web an' all...  I        *   FILE 509
//*           thought it was about time we dino's strike back       *   FILE 509
//*           :-)                                                   *   FILE 509

//*           This is a wrap'er program written in rexx that        *   FILE 509
//*           allows SHOWMVS to be called via a webserver.  It      *   FILE 509
//*           doesn't really do much other that reformat the        *   FILE 509
//*           output into HTML, but the result is quite nice.       *   FILE 509

//*           It could also serve as an example of how easy it      *   FILE 509
