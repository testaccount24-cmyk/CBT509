You must have a HTTP server up and running.



Check SDSF to see if you have something like WEB* or IMWEB* running

If you do then one of the first lines of JCL might be something like:
//IMWPROC PROC ICSPARM='-r /etc/httpd.conf -B',

The webserver configuration files are in /etc/httpd.*
/etc/httpd.conf contains the interesting stuff incl where to place cgi's



The rexx has to be put in a (HFS) library that is known to the webserver
as a cgi library.

Usually the webserver root directory would be something like /WWW and
the cgi directory would be /cgi-bin.
So that means that you would put the file in /WWW/cgi-bin/showmvs

From TSO you can use the following command to copy from PDS to HFS:

 TSO OPUT FILE509(SHOWMVS) '/WWW/cgi-bin/showmvs' TEXT

REMEMBER to set the file attributes to public execute (or 777 :-)



The easiest way to check all this is to use the OMVS/ISPF interface
"ISHELL". Then you can surf around in the HFS hierarchies using a nice
ISPF like interface and without knowing all these obscure unix commands
